# Painting-portraits

Project made with academic purposes for the Visual Computing lecture of the course M.Sc. Interactive Digital Media at Trinity College Dublin to demonstrate my knowledges in processing fundamentals.

The project is a portrait stylizer. It mimics a brushstroke appearance in photographed images. The project comes with 5 default images and allows the user to upload other 5 images. There is the option of saving the images where the user can chose the file extension, the default is .png.
